Buildings, like most other things, age badly if they’re not maintained. Some of the best mass housing projects in the UK [have disappeared because of terrible maintenance](https://citymonitor.ai/environment/how-poor-maintenance-londons-social-housing-created-conditions-its-demolition-1644).

Part of the issue is that about buildings once they are built are rarely made by the people that live in them. Maintenance, including landscaping and cleaning and fixing the lift and more, tends to be the responsibility of a property management company or a distant freeholder or the council.

This makes it harder for tenants to improve the buildings they live in. and means that decisions about a building in London are made by a freeholder investor in Guernsey. It used to be a big deal for architects. [Span Developments](https://www.michaelheyward.com/span/), for example, placed as much emphasis on how the housing was going to be managed as on the design of the houses themselves. But funding models and shrinking margins means that [it doesn’t really happen anymore](https://twitter.com/iotwatch/status/1578687483617103875).

To deal with this, tenants need to, surprise surprise, organise! There are a few ways for them to do this, using things like tenants and residents associations (TRAs), [co-ops](https://wellingtonmills.org.uk), [renters unions](https://www.instagram.com/dorchestercourt.tenantsunion/). TRAs are the simplest one, so I set up one up for the building that I live in. The main thing that it gives you is an ability to make decisions collectively:  a way of saying “we don’t like this thing, let’s do something about it” as a collective, rather than individually.

If you think you would benefit from one, start by getting your neighbours together. Chat about why you think it could be useful. There's probably something that will trigger it: a clear, shared need, like a leak or a lack of bike storage. To formally start a TRA, you need more than 50% of flats in your building to support the idea. To get there, we held a meeting with everyone to talk about the idea that we advertised with nice posters. After a while, when we were reasonably confident that we have the numbers, we made a survey asking people if they support it.

When that’s done, set up some simple ways of working that let everyone contribute. We have a WhatsApp chat for updates, a smaller chat for organising, a rolling document for more formal updates, calendar invites for meetings, and a shared Drive for other things. We also meet every other month and try to rotate who runs meetings. 

You also need a constitution. It’s not too important what’s in it and I don’t really understand the point, but I think your TRA is less likely to be recognised by others, like the council, if you don’t have one. Technically, there are also set roles that people need to play (chair, treasurer, secretary), but I don’t think you need to assign all of them unless you think you need it. 

You need to actively engage with people and over communicate. Not everyone is bothered by this stuff. This isn’t because they are not interested in what happens to the building they live in, but because they are busy with other things or because they wish it was less complicated. Reduce the barrier to entry as much as possible to get high participation.

A lot of what your TRA will be doing is just making sure the building is in a good state. Make sure to create space to work on more exciting improvements, as well. We have a shared courtyard and are working with an agency called [Light Follows Behaviour](https://lightfollowsbehaviour.com) to make the lighting better, and are also thinking about landscaping. 

There are [a lot of guides](https://londontenants.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Setting-up-and-sustaining-effective-TRAs-0821.pdf) on how to do this and a ton of examples of what they can do. My favourite are [pages 14-20 of this guidebook to an estate in Buckinghamshire](https://www.cedar-chase.org.uk/docs/cedar-chase-handbook-web.pdf), which goes through all of the materials that make it up, from doorbells to lettering on gate numbers, in an unbelievable level of detail.

Anyway, isn't this intersection of community organising and architecture and taking power away from landlords fun?!

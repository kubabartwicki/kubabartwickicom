(WIP but getting it out early)

Juxtaposing stuff is a great tool for thinking things through, but it can also limit thinking a lot. Here is one dichotomy that has been on my mind recently. Itâ€™s not some grand plea nor is it directed at anyone in particular. I just like working through things in writing, and all this blogging is giving me FOMO.

An organisation like GDS, (which is where I work, if youâ€™re here for a reason that isnâ€™t design in government), is special because it is responsible for both the front door to government, and the platforms that help teams across government build great services. The fact that we do both, and more, is what makes us more than a sum of our parts. More than just a digital publishing arm and more than just a platform shop. I guess it makes it also makes us quite a complicated, unusual organisation, which may have made it hard to establish a clear mission at times, but Iâ€™m not convinced that any of it is really that unusual.

Government is a very complex system, with a digital delivery model thatâ€™s federated to different organisations. The fact that all public services in the UK feel the same is a minor miracle, and testament to the amazing design choices made over the last decade. 

Radically improving the publicâ€™s experience of government, which weâ€™re obviously quite keen to do if you couldnâ€™t tell by the recent annoucements, will require working across the entire system. Because delivery is federated, platforms are the best enabler to the delivery of that experience. We know this, because it works: nothing else can scale the benefits of digital transformation as well, and this is recognised in both public and private sector. We need more and they need to be so good that departments want to adopt them.

But, how do you know which platforms to build, and how do you get it all to add up to a greater whole? You need a stupidly clear north star. It needs to be about some aspects of your intended user experience, it needs to be a work of fiction, it needs to be pretty shiny so that it appeals to a wide range of people who have no clue what a platform is, and it needs to be quite risky, because otherwise itâ€™s not ambitious enough. Yes, this work is a marathon, a slog, whatever â€“ but a view that engaging in wild future-making and sketching and playing isnâ€™t necessary is wrong. Shiny things can catalyse enabling change, create shared incentives across teams, and enable funding. Yes, itâ€™s a risky game, because it creates dependencies weâ€™re adults and we should be able to take calculated risks, and thereâ€™s no other way if we are to be ambitious. Just do it intentionally and responsibly.

And look, Iâ€™m a designer working on GOV.UK. I care enormously about the shiny things. I think how things look and feel is really important. Itâ€™s probably what makes me most excited about my role: being able to shape what public services feel like to people, and how they interact with it. (If youâ€™re a really senior person reading this â€“ we need a design director! Thereâ€™s going to be a lot of change to orchestrate, and having a designer close to the centre of power will help you make better decisions that help redefine the experience of public service in the UK for the better.)

We need a culture that takes both platforms and experiences for the public into account, cleverly manages the dependencies between them, and unlocks the multipliers that platforms working in tandem with experiences for people can afford.

Iâ€™ve got another one that was initially meant to be part of this. User needs vs innovation, up next. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m trying to pick a fight with everyone ðŸ¤ª
